00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,120
<i>It looks like the storm
has passed, New Yorkers.</i>

2
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
<i>A season-high seven inches
of rain last night.</i>

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,560
<i>High winds and flooding in some areas...</i>

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,560
<i>even left some New Yorkers stranded.</i>

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,560
<i>City crews still working this morning.</i>

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,560
<i>They're trying to restore power
to several areas in the boroughs.</i>

7
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,040
<i>Good news is, today should be sunny
with highs in the low 60s...</i>

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,200
<i>unseasonably mild...</i>

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,600
<i>a real change from the relentless weather
of these past few weeks.</i>

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,160
<i>So get out there, enjoy the sun,
go to the park, get outside if you can...</i>

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,240
<i>because it's not gonna last long.</i>

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,280
<i>Winter storms are turning
later in the week...</i>

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,480
<i>Making for a severe temperature drop
over the weekend.</i>

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,480
<i>Could be signs for an early
and potentially long winter.</i>

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,760
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>
33333333
20
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,690
It's been a while.

21
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,640
My condolences.

22
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,850
How are you holding up?

23
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,720
I keep asking, “Why her?”

24
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,080
There's no rhyme or reason to this life.

25
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,560
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.

26
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,040
Are you sure?

27
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
Don't blame yourself.

28
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,250
What are you really doing here, Marcus?

29
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,440
Just checkin' up on an old friend.

30
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
Good-bye, John.

31
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,000

- Yes.

32
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,650
Sign here, please.

33
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,640
And the pen.

34
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,760
Sorry.

35
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,080
- Here you go. Good night.
- Thanks.

36

someone to love.</i>

38
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,040
<i>So start with this.</i>

39
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,120

Hey.

53
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,520
On. Right.

54
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,200

55
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,530

- How much?
- Excuse me?

67
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,650
How much for the car?

68
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,480
She's not for sale.

80
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,330
Is it here?

81
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,650
It was.

Yeah.

00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,160
Get out of my shop. Get out right now.

87
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,600
Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio?
Because we own you.

What did you say to me?

We own you.

90
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,320
You don't own me, punk.

91
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,520
I work with your father. All right?

92
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,570
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?

93
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,000
No.

94
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,680

That's great, man. Come on.

101
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,570
Now, you kill me right now...

102
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,920
or you get the fuck out of my shop.

103
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,280
Viggo is not gonna like this.

104
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,200
How do you know what Viggo likes
or doesn't like?

105
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,600
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.

106
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,960
You've got a fuckin' pair on you, old man!

107
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,400

111
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I heard you struck my son.

112
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,000
- Yes, sir, I did.
- And may I ask why?

113
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,640
Yeah, well, because he stole
John Wick's car, sir...

114
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,120
and, uh, killed his dog.

115
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,680
Oh.

118

They've agreed to your terms.

119
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,480
It's not like you gave them
much of a choice anyway though, right?

120
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,160
Congratulations.

121
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,970
Sir?

122
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Have you seen my son?

123
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,520
How was your trip, kid?

124
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,080
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.

125
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,680
Or ever.

126
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,680
That's a nice jacket.

127
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,120
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

128
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,040
Ugh.

129
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,040
Should I go?

130
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,960
Nyet

131
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,800
- Viggo, English, please. Come on.
- Stay, goddamn it!

132
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,720
What did I do?

133
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,560
We did what you asked. No one saw shit.

134
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,200
I'm not talking about Atlantic City.

135
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,080
What then?

136
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,320
You mean Aurelio's?
So I stole a fucking car!

137
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,730
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

138
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,600
- Christ, Viggo.
- You stay!

139
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,810
It's not what you did, son,
that angers me so.

140
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,800
It's who you did it to.

141
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,530
Who? That fucking nobody?

142
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,360
That “fuckin' nobody”...

143
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,840
is John Wick.

144
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,810
<i>He once was an associate of ours.</i>

145
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,960
<i>They</i> call <i>him Baba Yaga.</i>

146
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,290
The boogeyman?

147
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,520
Well, John wasn't exactly the boogeyman.

148
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,560
He was the one you sent to kill
the fucking boogeyman.

149
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,170
Oh.

150
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,920
John is a man of focus...

151
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,240
commitment...

152
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,360
sheer will.

153
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,570
Something you know very little about.

154
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,600
I once saw him kill three men in a bar...

155
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,090
with a pencil.

156
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,880
With a fuckin'...

157
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,720
pencil.

158
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,760
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.

159
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,280
It's over a woman, of course.

160
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,080
<i>So I made a deal with him.</i>

161
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,250
I gave him an impossible task.

162
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,600
A job no one could have pulled off.

163
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,760
The bodies he buried that day...

164
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,040
laid the foundation of what we are now.

165
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,130
And then, my son...

166
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,760
a few days after his wife died...

167
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,330
you steal his car...

168
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,280
and kill his fuckin' dog.

169
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,330
Father, I can make this right.

170
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,210
Oh. How do you plan that?

171
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,200
By finishing what I started.

172
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,400
Did he hear a fucking word I said?

173
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,440
Iosef, Iosef, listen.

174
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
John will come for you.

175
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,090
<i>And you will do nothing...</i>

176
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,200
because you can do nothing.

177
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,930
So get the fuck out of my sight.

178
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,650
<i>Hello, John.</i>

179
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,960
I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry.

180
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,560
My condolences.

181
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,170
<i>It seems to be fate, or happenstance...</i>

182
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,320
<i>or just bad fuckin' luck
caused our paths to cross once again.</i>

183
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,560
John?

184
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,840
Let us not resort to our baser instincts...

185
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,490
<i>and handle this like civilized men...</i>

186
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,320
<i>to move on-</i>

187
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,680
What'd he say?

188
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,040
Enough.

189
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,360
Oh, God.

190
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,130
Task a crew.

191
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,850
H-How many?

192
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,440
How many do you have?

193
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
<i>Baba Yaga.</i>

194
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,610
Evenin', John.

195
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,800
Evenin', Jimmy.

196
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,480
Noise complaint?

197
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,560
Noise complaint.

198
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,810
You, uh, workin' again?

199
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,320
No, just sortin' some stuff out.

200
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,280
Ah, well...
